Whoa. Just walked out... Jumbo. What was that?? The sound system was way too loud, my ears are still ringing like a bunch of cicadas in summertime. It was like they cranked the volume to eleven and forgot to dial it back. My back's gonna need a chiropractor after those seats too. Do theaters think everyone's back is made of steel?? Anyway, back to Jumbo.

First off, I can't even begin to explain how mind-bending the visuals were. It was like Willy Wonka decided to open a theme park inside a kaleidoscope. At one point, there was this scene with spinning colors and lights... felt like being inside a giant lava lamp... but, like, if lava lamps had emotions and wanted to tell you something profound about life.

> Speaking of life.... how is popcorn this expensive? Shouldn't there be laws about that? Crumbs everywhere now, my sneakers are like mini gravel pits.

Oh, there was this bit with the ferris wheel that suddenly seems to glow all alien-like, and then it's like the machinery became sentient. I swear, the engineers who designed that ride were probably on something, not unlike the time I tried to plant cacti in my backyard. Ill-advised. I remember someone asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but after that mechanical ménage à trois scene, who could focus on that.

Narrative-wise, it was like herding a bunch of squirrels on a caffeine binge. Non-linear much? It started this way then suddenly, boom, you're in another storyline, another dimension, that echoes that time I went to the garden show and got lost in a zen maze. This one guy, I can’t remember his name, looked like a hybrid between a barista and a lumberjack. Every time he spoke, I felt like I was somehow being sold organic honey.

> There were moments where I thought I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a nature documentary on acid. You ever see an elephant turn into a cosmic nebula? Now I have.

About 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   again — just remembered. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if for no other reason than to see what I mean about the elephant. Just... the elephant.

And the ending... don't even get me started... or maybe do get me started, cause it was like they just... stopped. Like the director dropped their pen and walked off set. Boom, screen's black, credits roll. Half expected a secret message to pop up telling us some hidden truth about popcorn pricing conspiracies.

function thinkAboutJumbo() { 
    var reality = null;
    while (true) {
        console.log(What just happened??);
        if (reality) break;
    }
} 

Okay. Going to try and get these popcorn kernels out of my teeth. JL.
